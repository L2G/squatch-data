Squatch is short for "cybersquatter watch." It is (going to be) a free list of
IP addresses and networks where cybersquatting websites operate.

One practical use case: Link checking.  When a domain registration is left to
expire and a cybersquatter jumps on it, the link-checking app doesn't know
about it--it just keeps getting "200 OK" and thinks everything is fine.  The
Squatch list could help combat this problem.
